## About this Proof Of Concept demo
 - All data is persisted and hydrated as a single key-value record in KvDB.       
 - Data hydrates to an es6-Map (cache) using JSON.parse()    
 - The cache data is persisted in KvDB using JSON.stringyfy()    
 - Any mutation to the cache triggers a flush of the full dataset to KvDB.
